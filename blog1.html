        <h2>Blog Post: Gardening</h2>
        <p>
          Recently I’ve found that I’m interested in gardening. Both my mom and my
          aunt have very green thumbs. I’ve always liked having houseplants, but I
          had to rein in the number of funky, cool plants when I discovered that
          my cat enjoys eating them. It turns out that a lot of funky, cool plants
          aren’t safe for pets to eat. Go figure. So over the years I’ve had to
          stick with spider plants that Zoe occasionally gives a hair cut, and
          everybody stays alive.

          Now, I’m living in a house (not an apartment) for the first time since
          leaving the home I grew up in, and I want to take advantage of the yard,
          the space, and the sun.

          I discovered the farmer’s market, and specifically CSA’s right around
          the time that Nick and I first met. We were living the in Piedmont in
          North Carolina, where the growing season is just epically long, and we
          got a ridiculous amount of food from a local farm every week. Since
          moving to the Pacific Northwest, we have seen that while people who live
          here are gaga over the new trend of growing their own food, the growing
          season is significantly shorter here. We tracked down a CSA from a
          wonderful farm (Persephone Farm) that we get from mid-spring through the
          fall. But the weekly haul is less than what we are used to. Like,
          significantly less. And that’s ok! BUT now my curiosity about gardening
          has taken a turn, and I want to supplement our CSA with ultralocal
          produce…from my own backyard.

          A friend of mine gave me a comprehensive book about how to start a
          garden, titled Food Grown Right, In Your Backyard by Colin McCrate and
          Brad Halm. This book is accessible, has awesome photographs, and takes
          regional climates into consideration. Well I held on to this book for a
          while without every cracking the spine. I mean, Nick and I were planning
          our wedding! Who had time to garden at a time like that? With our
          honeymoon upon us, and a 6 hour flight to Hawaii looming, I thought that
          would be the perfect time to read this book.
