      This is a great way to make a quick, week night dinner that tastes like
      you spent all day in the kitchen. If you don’t have a pressure cooker, go
      out immediately and buy one! (We love our Fagor model.) But if you don’t
      have a Bed Bath & Beyond nearby, this recipe will still work in a regular,
      thick-bottomed stew pot/Dutch oven (you’ll just have to elongate the
      cooking time by a few hours).

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2-1lb of lamb stew meat cut into 1.5 inch chunks</li>

      keep lamb from sticking and burning to bottom) </li>
