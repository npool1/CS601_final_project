      The crowded kitchen is a space to share food stories and recipes. The site
      is produced and developed by Lost Otter Co-founder Adrienne Ostberg, and
      focuses on the culinary exploits of her and her husband, Nick. The hope is
      to bring you into the couple's small home kitchen to explore their love
      and knowledge of food. Please explore and feel to share your own recipes
      and stories!
