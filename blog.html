      <h2>Blog Post: Gardening</h2>
      <p>
        Recently I’ve found that I’m interested in gardening. Both my mom and my
        aunt have very green thumbs. I’ve always liked having houseplants, but I
        had to rein in the number of funky, cool plants when I discovered that
        my cat enjoys eating them. It turns out that a lot of funky, cool plants
        aren’t safe for pets to eat. Go figure. So over the years I’ve had to
        stick with spider plants that Zoe occasionally gives a hair cut, and
        everybody stays alive.

        Now, I’m living in a house (not an apartment) for the first time since
        leaving the home I grew up in, and I want to take advantage of the yard,
        the space, and the sun.

        I discovered the farmer’s market, and specifically CSA’s right around
        the time that Nick and I first met. We were living the in Piedmont in
        North Carolina, where the growing season is just epically long, and we
        got a ridiculous amount of food from a local farm every week. Since
        moving to the Pacific Northwest, we have seen that while people who live
        here are gaga over the new trend of growing their own food, the growing
        season is significantly shorter here. We tracked down a CSA from a
        wonderful farm (Persephone Farm) that we get from mid-spring through the
        fall. But the weekly haul is less than what we are used to. Like,
        significantly less. And that’s ok! BUT now my curiosity about gardening
        has taken a turn, and I want to supplement our CSA with ultralocal
        produce…from my own backyard.

        A friend of mine gave me a comprehensive book about how to start a
        garden, titled Food Grown Right, In Your Backyard by Colin McCrate and
        Brad Halm. This book is accessible, has awesome photographs, and takes
        regional climates into consideration. Well I held on to this book for a
        while without every cracking the spine. I mean, Nick and I were planning
        our wedding! Who had time to garden at a time like that? With our
        honeymoon upon us, and a 6 hour flight to Hawaii looming, I thought that
        would be the perfect time to read this book.
